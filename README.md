## mini-workshop to be held at University of Washington in Seattle, in January 2026

#### Topic: exploring aerosol-cloud μ-physics modelling concepts using productivity- and interactivity-oriented Python tools  

#### Contents:
- **Part 1**: [droplet condensational growth in an adiabatic parcel model](https://github.com/slayoo/seattle-erasmus-plus-hackathon/tree/main/part_1.ipynb)    
- **Part 2**: CCN activation via diffusional growth, evaportation and Ostwald ripening
- **Part 3**: [SDM collisional growth Monte-Carlo algorithm in a box model (with validation against analytic solution to Smoluchowski equation)](https://github.com/slayoo/seattle-erasmus-plus-hackathon/tree/main/part_3.ipynb)      
- **Part 4**: particle-based μ-physics simulations with diffusional & collisional processes using PySDM (box, parcel, single-column and beyond)
